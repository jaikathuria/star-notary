# Blockchain Data

Blockchain has the potential to change the way that the world approaches data. Develop Blockchain skills by understanding the data model behind Blockchain by developing your own simplified private blockchain.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

### Configuring your project

- Use NPM to install project dependencies.
```
npm install
```

##Functions

*All of the functions return a promise, so while testing make sure you use these functions with appropriate callback or `.then` or `.catch` methods.*

1. `addBlock` 
2. `getBlock`
3. `getBlockHeight`
4. `validateChain`
5. `validateBlock`

## Testing

To test code:
1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.

2: Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).
```
node
```
3: Copy and paste code from `app.js`'s *Initialization* section into your node session.

4: Below it some command snippets are given along with comments to what each comand does. Use them to test the blockchain.
